Elm Theme Viewer is an EFL(Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) elementary
widget preview program. It lists all the widget and the styles from the theme.
It actually creates widgets with a proper code.

Usage:
   $ elm_theme_viewer

It loads default theme (default.edj from /usr/local/share/elementary/themes) by
default. You can see the preview of other themes with the following instruction.

Usage2:
   $ elm_theme_viewer ./darkness.edj

This is a very useful program for elementary application programmers, elementary
theme creators, and elementary widget developers.
