Elm Theme Viewer is an EFL(Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) elementary
widget preview program. It lists all widgets and styles from the theme.  It
actually creates widgets with a proper code.
This is a very useful program for elementary application programmers,
elementary theme creators, and elementary widget developers.

Build and installation:
   $ ./autogen.sh && make && sudo make install

Usage 1:
   $ elm_theme_viewer

It loads default theme (default.edj from /usr/local/share/elementary/themes) by
default. But you can see the preview of other themes with the following
instruction.

Usage 2:
   $ elm_theme_viewer -t ./darkness.edj

Usage 3:
   $ elm_theme_viewer -h
